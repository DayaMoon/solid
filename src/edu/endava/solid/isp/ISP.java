/**
 * Interface segregation principle
 *
 * Within object-oriented design, interfaces provide layers of abstraction that facilitate conceptual explanation of the
 * code and create a barrier preventing dependencies.
 *
 *
 *
 * Using interfaces to further describe the intent of the software is often a good idea.
 *
 * @Important A system may become so coupled at multiple levels that it is no longer possible to make a change in one
 *            place without necessitating many additional changes. Using an interface or an abstract class can prevent
 *            this side effect.
 *
 *
 *            That is Program to Interface !!!
 *            Don't create FAT interfaces !!!
 *            Segregate more interfaces when needed !!!
